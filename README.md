# CS50W Project 0 — Google Search Clone

This is my first project for **CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript** by Harvard University.

The goal of this project was to recreate key functionality and layout from **Google Search**, including the main search page, image search, and advanced search.

## 🚀 Features

- **Main Search Page** — A clean Google-like homepage where users can perform text-based searches.
- **Image Search Page** — Allows users to perform image searches via a dedicated interface.
- **Advanced Search Page** — Includes multiple filters (exact phrase, excluding words, etc.) similar to Google’s advanced search options.
- **Responsive Design** — Styled with CSS to closely resemble Google’s design and maintain usability across screen sizes.
- **Navigation Bar** — Links between the main search, image search, and advanced search pages.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

(No JavaScript or Python backend was required for this project.)
